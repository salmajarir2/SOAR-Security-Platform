# Wazuh CDB List â€“ Malware Hashes

The **CDB list** in Wazuh serves as a repository for distinct hashes or checksums of malicious and benign files. It allows the Wazuh security platform to precisely compare cryptographic representations of files on endpoints with those in the CDB.

The CDB list can include:

* Users
* File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256â€¦)
* IP addresses
* Domain names

This document covers:

2. Setting up the Wazuh server
3. Configuring Windows endpoints
4. Testing the detection
5. Visualizing alerts

## 1. How the CDB List Works

A CDB list is a plain text file that stores entries in either `key:value` or `key:only` format. It can function as an **allow** or **deny** list.

Wazuh processes the CDB list as follows:

1. **Hash generation** â€“ Store known hashes (benign or malicious).
2. **File comparison** â€“ During scans, Wazuh computes hashes of monitored files and compares them to the CDB entries.
3. **Identification** â€“ If a hash matches a malicious one, Wazuh flags the file.
4. **Alerts & Reactions** â€“ Based on rules, Wazuh can trigger alerts or automated responses.

## 2. Setting up the Wazuh Server

1. **Create a new CDB list file**

```bash
nano /var/ossec/etc/lists/malware-hashes
```

2. **Add malware hashes**

Use the format:

```
<malware-hash>:<malware-name>
```

For example:

```
44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f:mirai
098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6:xbash
5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592:fanny
```

ðŸ‘‰ Public malware hash lists can be downloaded from trusted sources like [Nextron Systems IOC repository](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/iocs/hash-iocs.txt).

3. **Add the CDB list to Wazuh config** (`/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`):

```xml
<ruleset>
  <!-- Default ruleset -->
  <list>etc/lists/malware-hashes</list>
</ruleset>
```

4. **Create a custom rule** (`/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`):

```xml
<group name="malware,">
  <rule id="110002" level="13">
    <if_sid>554, 550</if_sid>
    <list field="md5" lookup="match_key">etc/lists/malware-hashes</list>
    <description>Known Malware File Hash is detected: $(file)</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1204.002</id>
    </mitre>
  </rule>
</group>
```

5. **Restart Wazuh Manager**

```bash
systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

---

## 3. Configuring Windows Endpoints

To detect file changes on a Windows endpoint, configure **Syscheck** in the agent config:

```xml
<ossec_config>
  <syscheck>
    <disabled>no</disabled>
    <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">C:/Users/USERNAME/Downloads</directories>
  </syscheck>
</ossec_config>
```

Restart the Wazuh Agent:

```powershell
net stop wazuh-agent
net start wazuh-agent
```



## 4. Testing

1. Place a file with a known malicious hash (e.g., Mirai sample hash) inside the monitored folder.
2. Wait for Wazuh to perform a hash comparison.
3. If a match occurs, the custom rule **110002** will trigger.

---

## 5. Visualizing Alerts

* Alerts can be viewed from the **Wazuh Dashboard (Kibana/Elastic)** under the Security Events section.
* Matching logs will display the rule `Known Malware File Hash is detected`.
* You can then escalate to **TheHive** or trigger automation with **Shuffle** as part of your SOAR workflow.
